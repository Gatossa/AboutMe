### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mastering my skills as a software tester. 
ğŸ”­ I am searching for the job in testing field and due to the fact I am currently not working as a software tester I take courses all the time not to forget skills I have learnt.

:sweat_drops: I am currently learning Postman.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new projects in a new company

âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing drums (still learning..... ğŸ˜‰ )
