### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mastering my skills as a software tester. I am searching for the job in testing field and due to the fact I am not working as a software tester for the time being I take courses all the time not to forget skills I have learnt.

:sweat_drops: At present I am working on mastering Postman.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new projects in a new company

âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing drums (still learning..... ðŸ˜‰ )
